Thank you, Chuck, for the kind intro and hello, everyone and welcome. So delighted to have a year. I'm glad you could take the time out to be with us here today, and it means a lot to us. We promised to surprise you with some amazing innovations that the teams have been working on, and I think you're gonna love it. But before we do that, I wanted to take a moment and spend some time to talk to you about what WebEx really stands for. As Jack mentioned, our mission is to build an inclusive future for all. And that's our core value now in the world that we live in. It's unfortunate, but opportunity is pretty unevenly distributed. Even the human potential is not. And I fundamentally believe that technology can change that for us, this chance to level the playing field. So the same is one of the things that we get so excited about it. Cisco let me provide some color on what I mean by that. There's about three billion digital workers on the planet today, but a billion of those are knowledge workers. Another two billion happen to be frontline and field workers Our goal is to make sure that regardless of off geography, language, preference, personality type, we're able to make it possible for any of these three billion digital workers to equally participate in the global economy. Whether it's a person in a village in India or someone in the heart of Silicon Valley, they should have an equal voice. There should be no second class citizens in the workplace, so the question is, how do we go about achieving this? Now we can achieve this by starting to make sure that the WebEx experiences 10 x better than in person interactions. Because when we could make the virtual experiences orders of magnitude better than in person interactions, geography will no longer be an unfair advantage. Our managers will feel confident in the way that we, the fact that we could work from anywhere, and companies will be able to make sure that they can access a global talent pool rather than being restricted by the talent pool. Most importantly, everyone's gonna be able to get a seat at the table, no matter where the table is. This is how we think we can create inclusive future for all, and this is what we want to do with WebEx and have the right investments being made. So this becomes a reality. Now. 2020 was anything but a predictable year, and it's been a hard year today when we think about the problems facing us. Post co vid We all want to make sure that we can empower remote workers as companies to seamlessly collaborate with anyone from anywhere, so that business continues. But when it's time to get back to the office, we want to make sure that there's an enablement of safe return back to the office. And eventually, companies want to make sure that they can delight their customers by providing exceptional experiences. And to do this in a secure and insightful way. Keeping in mind that privacy is a basic human right is paramount to a company's success. Now the holder I've gotten, the more I've realized that the most precious resource all of us have is our time.
 
 -------------------segment-------------- 
 
Working in a global environment can be extremely stressful. To be included in the conversation shouldn't require that we burn ourselves out. For example, my team at Cisco is pretty distributed globally, were frequently dealing with people in multiple different time zones, as I'm sure you are a swell scheduling time to have a synchronous conversation could be a complete nightmare sometimes because it's not like you have an eight hour day that overlaps with each other. When you're in multiple different time zones, you probably have an hour and a half if you're in three different continents. And that's if you work a 12 hour day. I was to solve really hard problems like these that we built the all new WebEx your next generation connections platform. Let's take a look. Yeah, shit, shit, shit, you know, absolutely love that video, But I love even Mawr is a product of the team is built. But before we dive into the details of the all new WebEx, I wanted to share with you three key design goals we kept in mind as we were building the product. The first design goal was to provide you with the perfect blend of synchronous communication with asynchronous communication, because we're not always going to be connected in real time efficiently. The second key design goal was to make sure that we can inject a degree of spontaneity and not just have every interaction. Be a planned interaction because you don't want to lose the richness of the interactions that happened in the hallway conversation or dropping by a colleague's desk or catching up in the coffee room. And the third design goal, which is a really important design goal, was quality over quantity. And I fundamentally believe our industry is optimized for the wrong metrics. It isn't how many minutes we've spent on a call. It isn't how maney meetings we've participated in or how many messages we've we've we've sent. Instead, it's how much we've gotten done and to share more of this with you and what we've built with these design goals in mind, I'd like to introduce applied to show you this in action. Thank you, G two. As you do said, the all new WebEx experience is 10 x better than in person interactions. That's a tall order, But let me show you how we're going to do that. We're really excited about what we have done here. I'm sure you're gonna love it. As the entire world moved toe working from home, it became clear that your ability to appear professional in a meeting depended on many things that up until now were not relevant. Your environment, for example. Many people didn't necessarily have a home office or could not afford one. If you had to take a video meeting from your breakfast counter or from your patio table, all from your living room sofa, ambient noise became a huge source of distraction. With our background noise removal technology from Babel Labs, we were able to put technology to good use to level the playing field and make everyone appear professional no matter where they were. We use artificial intelligence to distinguish background noise from human speech so that background noise can be removed without affecting the fidelity off human speech. This technology works equally well with all kinds of noise dishes in kitchen barking dogs, a vacuum cleaner or a leaf blower just to name off the offer. Examples.

Let's take a look at this technology in action. Thanks for jumping on a call. I had a quick question about our marketing program. Sorry, it just caught me making a snack, but that marketing program is going to wow our customers. Suzanne, why are you shouting? You're telling me you can hear me over making a smoothie. That is incredible. WebEx background noise removal. Isn't it incredible that Suzanne decided to start her blender while she was in the meeting? As we started spending more and more time in meetings, we all developed our favorite way to see other participants and any content they're sharing. But often times you want to focus on a few participants, putting them on the virtual stage. It was time to re imagine meeting layouts with the all new Web backs. You can set your stage to your liking. You can start with the familiar great view, but use the slider to Sochaux as many or as few participants as you want, and then you can stack the rest of the participants on the side. Scrolling through the participants is just like you would scroll through a document. Now you can add additional presenters to the stage simply by dragging and dropping the presenters on the virtual stage. See how we teach how easy it is and then as a presenter, if you have the perfect set up for your meeting, you can then go ahead and said that view for everybody in the meeting. Not only that, taking inspiration from the weather men and women that we've seen the news. We thought it would be a great idea toe. Blend your video with content. Introducing the new immersive share immersive share allows you to bring yourself closer to your audience without them having to take their eyes off content you're presenting. You can resize your video and place it wherever you want on the screen. By blending your video and content together, your audience can get fully immersed in your meeting. Isn't that beautiful? When was the last time you thought your meeting was beautiful and 10 times better than in person? Interactions are even Mawr applicable to large events as organizations which toe working from home, conducting large town halls to keep in touch with your employees became even more important to business leaders. I know off several CEO Chuck Robbins, for example, and see X O's, who conduct regular check ins with their employees and product leaders and marketers also started to do a lot of webinars. These meetings now needed to scale to a much larger remote user population. We are happy to announce that we are now losing two different modes for you to conduct events you can choose the one that works for you the best. As you know, WebEx events today has a highly interactive experience where attendees can raise hand, come off off, mute and ask a question.Perfect events will now also support advanced abilities like live transcription Panelists lobby and practice practice sessions from the get go, followed by producer layouts, moderated video Q and A and break out sessions. Not only that, WebEx events will progressively support up to 25,000 attendees. There are times, however, when users want to simply broadcast a live message or want to showcase a promotional video toe. A broad audience where feedback over chat is just fine. And two way live interactions are not really necessary to cater toe that need. We are all now introducing the Web Webcast mode, which can allow you to scale up 200,000 attendees. With these two modes, you can rest assured that your high stakes high reach meetings can be done seamlessly, and we're really excited to bring this innovation to you. Now let's talk about some other challenges with work from home. If your calendar is like mine and it is booked all day with back to back meetings. I'm sure some of these meetings run over and you are late toe all subsequent meetings. Now you are dragging the rest of the team with you, making everybody less productive. Some of these meetings are what we think are quick sink meetings where you may want to just get a question clarified and don't need more than a few minutes. Yet just because Outlook decided to default toe 30 minute durations for meetings, we end up booking 30 minutes in our calendar. Instead of setting up meetings based on the least amount of time in outlook, we needed to find a new way to work. We're now announcing the WebEx meeting templates. WebEx meeting templates allow you to create various different types off meetings that do not have to fit within the 30 minute bound. That outlook imposes on you. And the first amongst that is what we call a quick sink meeting. Introducing the quick sink meeting just like Twitter forces you to make your point in 280 characters or less. Quick sing meeting allows us to have meetings within a specific time limit. And once that title met SE seven minutes in this case expires. That meeting just ends. You can schedule such a meeting, and when the attendees see the schedule there, it's pretty clear that's a seven minute quick sink meeting. And to join the meeting, there's a timer that tells you how much time you have left. Having a timer that counts down can speed up your conversations so that you can focus on getting things done. Now, if you are a team leader or manager, you often have meetings where you want to solicit feedback from everybody in the meeting. In a typical meeting, a few people end up hogging the mic and drown out all of the participants. And if you are the introvert who does not want to speak up unless given an opportunity, you will end up being a silent observer throughout the meeting, the all new WebEx Everyone has a voice, So how do we ensure everyone has voice to address this? We turned to the real world, where soliciting everyone's input is done in a structured way, and we look to none other than the U. S. Supreme Court for inspiration in the Supreme Court when there's a case being heard, the council gets to speak for two minutes uninterrupted. Such a two minute rule could be extremely beneficial in a round table meeting, ensuring everybody gets their fair share off time to speak.
 
 -------------------segment-------------- 
 
Our new roundtable WebEx template lets you do exactly that. You can set up your meeting and you can set up your agenda for the meeting, and you can make sure that everyone has a chance to speak one speaker at a time. When you join the meeting, you can see that there is a familiar timer, but it also tells you who is speaking. The active speakers identified. And then when you go open up the participant list, you can see who has taken turns and who is up next to speak Quick Sink Roundtable. They're just examples of WebEx templates, and we'll be adding many more in the next few months with the all new WebEx. Everyone has a voice, but what if you speak a different language? Last summer released the industry's first meeting assistant that also doubled down to provide close captioning in meetings. This allowed people with hearing disabilities to participate in meetings by reading close captions, but many times you have people with diverse backgrounds where the language spoken in the meeting may not be the language of their choice and inclusive meeting application needs toe provide the tools necessary for participants to read close captions in the language of their choice. Introducing riel time language translations With this feature, Not only can you get close captioning, but you can see that in the language of your choice. In this example, we started off with English, then went to Spanish, and then even you can choose languages like Mandarin. We're starting with the top 15 languages used in the world that cover more than 80% of the world's population. And going forward will be adding several more languages to the mix, giving equal voice to everyone in the meeting dr that inclusive behavior in your team, no matter your geographic location, where you come from, your personality type, what language you speak or whether you have special needs. With the all new WebEx, everyone is included. Oftentimes, when you're the large meeting and you're presenting, if you're like me, you want the audience to give your feedback. Speaking to lots of people on mute isn't particularly appealing to me or, for that matter, any other presenter. Most people are polite, though, and do not want to interrupt the speaker even when you invite them to interrupt you. But most people give feedback using their body language. We built in meeting reactions to allow people to provide feedback without having to interrupt you. But we soon discovered that even though little kids in school quickly found this feature and used it a lot, some of them not so tech savvy users never used it. We thought it might be a great idea if it's somehow let the users discover meeting reactions by simply detecting their body language. This will allow for people. This will allow for non power users off WebEx be as productive as power users. With video meetings and artificial intelligence, we are now able to let you provide in meeting reactions and feedback. Using natural gestures, you can give a thumbs up or down on applause to trigger reactions or simply raise your hand to raise hand in the meeting. We'll make sure the gestures that we build our localized across the world to honor the regional culture. This powerful features allows everybody in the meeting to provide feedback while at the same time being polite and for presenters to accept feedback from all the attendees. Hand just a recognition will be released in the upcoming release. Off the all new Web backs, meetings, templates, gestures are examples of features that make interactions on WebEx 10 times better than in personal interactions and in doing so, make us a lot more productive. Speaking of productivity, our in meeting WebEx assistant always had the ability to generate action items and highlights.After the release off our assistant last summer, we have seen tremendous usage and adoption across all customers. The all new WebEx now has post meeting highlights that are made very simple and consumable so that you can access them, share them, edit them and edit all your meeting artifacts like action items and notes. Also making it easy toe allow you to jump to the part of the meeting that you want to review quickly without having to go through the entire meeting recording. We truly believe that productive meetings are the ones that do not generate additional meetings. That's right, meetings that lead to fewer meetings by allowing you to collaborate on your meeting action items. A synchronously. You can eliminate the need for synchronous video collaboration and help reduce video fatigue. But that usually comes with the problem off explosion off messages in this world. Today, we're inundated with all kinds of information text messages, social media applications, notifications from various different applications. How do you prioritize work messages with the all new WebEx? We're now bringing the ability for you to prioritize how you respond to messages by leveraging WebEx craft, which you're gonna hear about very soon. We can build relationship intelligence to surface the most important message for you. For example, a message from your manager. These messages are highlighted where you can quickly read them, react to them or do a quick reply like in this case, and if for some reason we are in prioritizing a message for you, you can provide feedback to the system so that the system can learn what is most important for you. As you can see, our teams have been busy with the all new WebEx. Everyone is included. Everyone has a voice and everyone participates. WebEx enables inclusive collaboration anywhere, anytime, making our vision off the all new WebEx being 10 X better than in person interactions a reality. There's more to come. Let me hand it back to Jato. Thank you. Bye. All folks, that's the all new WebEx that were so excited about. We hope you enjoy using it. As much as we've all enjoyed building it, you're gonna love it. But that's not all. In fact, we're just getting started. What I'd like to do next is walk you through our complete strategy at all the areas you could expect massive innovation from us and how you experienced WebEx to start with, you know, that we're gonna be investing very heavily in a collab app sweet, which includes meetings, messaging, calling, but also white boarding, polling Q and A and much, much more. Now all of these aspects are also going to be exposed as an API and sdk layer in the platform targeted for developers so that they could not only customized applications but also integrate with other eyes fees easily and make sure that we can embed WebEx into custom applications. I know that WebEx was built for a very broad audience of hundreds of millions of users, but there are times when people need specialized experiences for a very targeted set of personas for very, very specific use cases that need to get caters to.We're going to use our platform capabilities to make sure that those applications get built ourselves as well as we leverage a partner ecosystem in areas that they have domain expertise so that they can extend the platform for building applications themselves. Now, once you've had those specialized experiences, they're all gonna be made available to the devices that you know in love. But that's not all. We'll also make sure that we have a fabric of AI capability that's available in the platform so that magical functionality can be made available to you and keep getting better and better and better over time. Now Cisco is all about security, privacy compliance, and we wanted to make sure that that was something that was built from the ground up with the platform rather than something something that's an afterthought that's bolted on. And that's what we've done with our security capabilities. Within the platform on our fundamental belief is that privacy is a basic human right, and we must honor and respect that at all times. So, folks, that's the WebEx Connections platform. Let's take a deeper look to further expand on how we've completely reimagine a few of these experiences. I'd like to introduce Larissa thanks to you to the all new WebEx is our integrate experience across calling, meetings, messaging presence and much more. Think of it like your connection platform or communication os. I can't wait to show you some of my favorite features. We have personally been using the all new WebEx as a distributed team even prior to the pandemic, but our work cell was really put to the test over the last nine months. We haven't been in the same building since the start of the year. Yet we've been delivering experiences that are 10 X better than in person interactions every day while apart. When we're in the office, it was so easy to see when someone was available. You can catch them when they left the meeting early or see them at their desk busy. Not wanting to be interrupted in our new remote world, we rely on the WebEx presence feature to help us find moments for spontaneous productivity while respecting ones needs for independent work time. Our presence delivers a rich awareness across our software and hardware experiences. Unlike no one in the industry, WebEx can automatically represent when you're in a meeting on a call presenting or away from your work. We also respect your need for independent time or time for personal commitments. Last but not least, we let every window when you're on vacation at a glance, I can see who's available across my entire team. Now that's a 10 X better than in person interaction. In reality, our physical distribution around the world campus or even a single building makes it impossible for me to see all of my teammates at a moment. Well, President, help me find spontaneous one on one time. I frequently need to get my entire team together for a quick decision or brainstorm these air typically unplanned get togethers, sometimes due to an emergency other times due to a good idea that just needs team momentum. The all new WebEx isn't just about scheduled meetings. It enables spontaneous work like no other. With our WebEx huddle feature, you can quickly call specific team members into quick conversation with a single click. You simply find the right space based on topic people or event and hit huddle.This starts the huddle and sends a notification for everyone in the team to join. All space members can join, regardless of whether they are internal or external to your organization. No scheduling, no agenda, no prep. Just a quick call to get everyone together to get stuff done. My next favorite thing about the all new WebEx is that it is rich enough to be your personal phone. Our APP works with all traditional work clothes from multi line for sales teams to hunt groups for contact center agents. While it can connect and control your desk phone in the office, it can also fully function as your business phone while at home. Most importantly, it elevates the call experience from audio to video. The all new WebEx makes it easier to virtually stopped by anyone's desk as well as bring your team together, all while enabling your customers and your partners to reach you no matter where you work. What I'm excited to share next is how we're changing the world of calling. Today we own over 50% market share in calling. We connect over 1.2 billion people over phone calls each month. As G two mentioned, we are building an inclusive future for all three billion digital workers today. Meeting supports many of the one billion knowledge workers. But calling will impact the two billion field and frontline workers. We're evolving, calling from a hearing only experience to seeing and doing more with the people you talk to. The younger generations have already redefined their expectations of a call. I know my daughter thinks the phone is broken whenever she's talking to Grandma and can't see her. This calling evolution will enhance every interaction from patient to Dr Citizen to government. Shopper to vendor. One of the biggest differences between a meeting in a call is that you just don't know when someone will call you. Today we will look at scenarios across the field. Worker shopper on patient, WebEx is powering calls across industries. Many field workers experience challenges that require remote assistance or help on site audio. Only support takes an entire description of the problem before even starting on the solution. Let's face it, a picture is worth 1000 words. Our solution provides a hands free communication experience that is initiated by a quick call from the field worker to the expert. WebEx expert on demand enables the remote worker to see and hear what the field worker is seeing so they can quickly work together on a solution. Not only that, the remote expert is able to deliver annotations on the video directly to the field worker, making it easier to pinpoint and solve problems in partnership with really, where we have delivered the same experience as being on site. Next, let's take a look at how we're reimagining the shopping experience.Here you have a customer shopping on their mobile device. They need some assistance. Well, not entering the store. How often have you called into the store? Frustrated with complex calling menus and boring hold times. With WebEx calling, customers no longer have to waste time dealing with complex audio menus there, instead presented with a video menu, this streamlines the connection to the sales associate in the store. With our experience, they don't just hear the sales associate. They're able to see them. After successful sale, the customer is on hold waiting for final confirmation. Instead of boring whole music, they're served with a short video on the new curbside pickup process. This customer now feels better prepared for their safe pick up. Finally, I want to share how we have reimagined the healthcare experience during the pandemic. WebEx, in partnership with Eva Robotics, delivers evolve, calling to connect families while keeping our frontline workers safe. Let's take a look right now. The patients were isolated. They haven't been able to see their families, so we needed a way that was fast, reliable and easy for everyone to use. Eva has provided a opportunity to go room to room and have the doctor visit the residents. Most powerful thing was for me two hours after arrive. There were family visiting already. When I'm getting wheeled down the hallway between rooms, patients will be waving at me. It could go in there. I can adjust it so that we could see the resident very clear. Way found. All sorts of unexpected efficiencies were saving commuting time. I could do a couple of things that could have a couple of different screens opens now. They could go assess the patient on demand way got this where they are. Well, we chose *** because if it's enterprise grade communication being able to connect with people, but you don't get to visit is everything. As you just saw. The all new WebEx isn't just about getting work done. It makes every experience better for the shopper remote worker and even connecting loved ones.

WebEx calling our multi tenant Cisco hosted cloud calling is bringing these game changing calling experiences to 84 countries and counting. Now that I've shown you the all new WebEx, I want to tell you how we're making it easier to get the best that we have to offer. Our flex plan allows you to get mawr from WebEx at a better price. We have also extended our P S T n options to now include the new Cisco calling plan available in the US than Canada and 20 more countries before the summer of next year. Last but not least, give our app try by downloading the latest on webex dot com. I hope you're as excited as I am about the impact we can deliver together by enriching the calling experience around the world. Thank you. Back to you do too. Hey, thanks, Larissa. As you can see, folks, we're pretty excited to be your next generation connections platform starting by providing a world class collab ops sweet. But there's more, and I'm really excited today to announce Cisco's intent to acquire Slider. It's a technology company headquartered in Bratislava, Slovakia, and the all new WebEx will, soon as a result of this acquisition, be able to offer a best in class audience engagement platform that's significantly heightens participant engagement before, during and after meetings for and events for both in person as well as virtual audiences. Let me show you how this manifest in the WebEx experience itself. So if your user of WebEx as a host, you can insert a questionnaire or a pole to drive engagement, and this is largely designed so that there's more interactivity, it feels more conversational. You can inject data into the entire experience as you move forward, and then, once you've entered these kind of questions in as an attendee, you will be able to fill out these questions in real time and see other people's asked kind of answers as well. So even the ideas that even broadcast will feel like conversations. This is a great mechanism to provide audience engagement in real time. It works for everyone from the smallest of groups to the largest of events. I really want to extend a warm welcome to my good friend Peter. Good morning. Who is the CEO of slide? Oh, on the entire slide. Oh, team. You know, I joined Cisco back in August, and one of the first people I reached out to was Peter to say, Hey, I think it might be better for us to join forces and go at it together. And the more we started talking to each other, the more excited regards. Wow! And so I can't wait for you to see all the innovation that we'll be able to bring together to you jointly. But that's not it, because we'll continue to make sure that slider also integrates with Google slides and Google Meat and Microsoft PowerPoint and teams and into Zoom just to make sure that we can continue our commitment to support an open ecosystem. Now, as you know, we've built products that could be used by hundreds of millions of people, and the beauty about our product is that we have a single product that could be used by businesses or government employees or students or anyone in between. But Sometimes people want specialized experiences that are very targeted to solve very specific problems for distinct personas and specific use cases.

Still using the magic, of course, of the underlying technology platform that we have, like audio video collaboration capabilities. What have you and a great example of this is our contact center technology that we're currently a market leader off, but we felt we could do a whole lot more in this area. So today I'm excited to announce the all new WebEx Contact Center. It's designed completely from the ground up for the cloud. It's a completely modern and modular experience for the contact center agent. Let me share with you our perspective on why this is really, really important, because when a customer calls, they should expect a seamless interaction when they only have to provide information once rather than have to keep repeating it over and over again. If they get transferred from one place to the other, they should expect that the agent knows who they are and has all the context on the history right in front of them and, most importantly, can resolve issues quickly and efficiently. So this all new kind of WebEx Contact center is going to allow you to do this in a really modular way, regardless of the channel that the customer can communicate with you on. Whether it be WhatsApp SMS phone call, they'll have all the history and context. They'll have a completely modular applications so that they don't have to keep switching applications back and forth, and it's going to provide a delightful experience back to your customer. But that's not it. This is a really, really exciting announcement, but we have one more announcement in this area. And by the way, if you want to see more about this announcement, make sure you attend tomorrow's keen out because Javy, then Omar will talk to you a whole lot more about the WebEx Contact Center. And the entire market of customer experience is a service, and we're doubling down further on enhancing customer experience today with our pending acquisition of I my mobile. Now, as a result of this acquisition of my mobile, will be able to add true Omni Channel capability to our portfolio, creating a world where organizations can stay constantly connected to their customers in the way that they want. Each interaction will be faster and smarter, and there's an opportunity to deliver rich, engaging and intuitive experiences. Um, for the customer, I think I might put the best over here, which is every interaction matters. Together with my my mobile. The new WebEx Contact Center will offer a full configurable Omni Channel solution, including many popular channels like SMS, WhatsApp and many, many More. They'll make it a whole lot easier for organizations to stay constantly connected with its customers and deliver delightful experiences across the entire life cycle of customer interaction. All right, Max, let's talk about devices now. In addition to working with Apple, Google and Microsoft Devices, which we're going to do an amazing job with, WebEx is optimized to work with our award winning device portfolio. In addition to WebEx phones that enable billions of connections each month and the WebEx room, Siri's like the panorama that you've learned to know in love. We're now expanding to the WebEx desk, Siri's with three brand new products. Meet the WebEx desk Um, or compact device for any desk at a super attractive price point. It's a beautiful 24 inch, all in one smart display that could be used in the home or in the office and gives you a powerful set of AI features like noise removal and delivers background replacement. It can also act as a companion monitor. You will be amazed with the magical sound and video quality of this device, and it really helps reduce fatigue when you're in front of the device for a long time. Next, I'd like to introduce you to the WebEx desk camera. For those of us who are frustrated using poor quality laptop in computer cameras delivers a superior four K quality ultra HD video resolution in vibrant color.It works marvelously well in low lighting as well. Frankly, and the small device provides a truly magical experience at a reasonable place, and it looks beautiful. It comes in black and white over the past few months. One thing that we know for certain is that the future of work is for sure gonna be hybrid. Some days people are gonna be working from the office. On some days, they're gonna be working from home and some days, somewhere in the middle. As we move into this hybrid reality, our office configuration might also change. Some companies might wanna have less dedicated desks to better utilize this space and adjust the new work patterns, but just a new work patterns. Now companies will want to make sure that regardless of which desk you sit at, it feels like your personal office to make this a reality. We thought long and hard, and we've imagined a whole new device category. We call this device category the WebEx Desk Cup. Now you might ask, What does this beautiful WebEx desktop do? Well, it instantly makes anywhere you are personalized for you. It detects your phone on acts as a hub for the rest of your devices. Imagine walking up to a desk, any desk, putting your phone, your mobile phone on the dust cub. And it instantly knows your preferences, your identity, your calendar. If even displays your pictures. What desk phones did for hotel ing as a use case the desk hub will do for hot desk ing is a use case, and by the way, it also has a phone in it. Folks, I can't wait for you to try this out. I think you're gonna love it now. We're not just a collection of APS specialized experiences and devices. WebEx is a true platform, and to talk to you more about how we leverage the platform to deeply integrated an ecosystem of applications, I'd like to introduce journal thanks. You too, like G two said earlier. WebEx is not just a powerful suite of applications. It's also a platform with an ecosystem of integrations and APs to help you get your work done. Now let's take a look at that ecosystem and how a pub and the WebEx platform helps everyone do their best work every day. Everywhere. Our platform starts with a powerful open set of APIs and STX. This lets anyone light up and build the capabilities they need with WebEx. And we're at even Mawr functionality in the coming months to this platform, like letting you add tab applications within a P I and improvements to our bendable widgets and sdk help developer build even better solutions.

Next, we have a comprehensive developer program to help our partners and customers build solutions. Earlier today, you heard Larissa Horton highlight just a few examples of the game changing solutions that we are partners have built, like expert on demand with real wear. And there's an even broader range of other solutions out there that are being built today. Solving big problems across some of our most critical industries and verticals, from health care to education, government and even manufacturing. Now, for all the developers out there, visit developer webex dot com for access toe all of the assets we have for you, including documentation, white papers and even getting started samples so you can get going in minutes. Finally, we power up your everyday work with a rich set of integrations available in our refreshed app hub. Thes integrations help you get work done across a wide swath of business areas from incident response to sales engagement, document collaboration, toe orchestration and automation. With this, a pub refresh. These integrations are readily available at your fingertips. And thanks to work coming soon, you'll also be able to find and use these APS during your meetings. All this means that whatever APS you use, they just work with WebEx to help you get more work done, done faster and done better. And unlike some of the other platforms out there with WebEx, you'll be able to find and use these APS before dream and after your meetings We're super excited about all of the existing and our new and enhanced integrations coming your way in the near future. And trust me, there will be many later today. We'll even give you a sneak peek at some of the upcoming integrations with box salesforce and service. Now, tomorrow you'll see our Facebook and Dropbox integrations. We'll show you how they make your life better. And why are partners are excited about them? But for now, back to G to to walk you three more exciting news about WebEx. Thank you, John O. Now John had talked about a really important part of our platform strategy, which is enabling the entire ecosystem toe work closely with WebEx. Regardless of the application, you as a user or using you should be able to work seamlessly with WebEx. But there's another really important innovation I'd like to share with you in this area of platform, and that's WebEx graph. Over the past few years, we've invested pretty heavily in our data platform to better understand the inter relationships between people, teams, devices, meetings, messages and interactions overall, and assessing the patterns of how people interact. It's something that could be used to deliver pretty meaningful insights to individuals, teams and organizations. We'll take a look at some examples shortly, but know that this is a key part of our strategy moving forward for the platform. And we've done this with an extreme emphasis on protecting the individual users. Privacy. Now, part of being a platform is to make sure that artificial intelligence is a core part of the fabric of the platform. Are past few years, we've invested pretty heavily in the AI capability stack with WebEx to the tune of over a billion dollars. And some of the capabilities we've delivered include auto transcription or real time language translation, facial recognition.People count within rooms, WebEx assistant gesture recognition and so much more. The most recently, we added background noise removal capability to bring AI to enhance video quality with our recent acquisition of Babel Labs. Another important advancement we made in the world of AI has been fundamentally reimagining people insights powered by WebEx craft and to show you more about it, let me introduce Yvonne and Laura from our artificial intelligence team. Thanks G two and hello, everyone. For the last few years, we've been working hard building the WebEx graph, a data platform that unites billions of data points from across the WebEx product suite and the Web at large. We take inputs like your WebEx meeting and messaging activity, your company directory and your online public footprint. We then combine them to a rich understanding of you, your work habits that people around you, the activities you share and the relationships that tie it all together. Now, let's say, for example, you recently joined a new team within your company. WebEx Craft knows that you attended over a dozen meetings with your new colleagues this week. It knows that there are two people on the team you're already very familiar with, and five people who you've rarely or never interacted with before, including one who went to the same college is you small world right WebEx graph. Already powers features like people insights and Message highlights and WebEx and Analytics Tools and Control hub. We believe it can do so much more, are incredibly excited to announce the launch of the next set of features powered by WebEx graph. I'll pass it over to Yvonne to tell you more. Thanks, Laura. Today we're announcing the all New People Insights, which uses insights derived from WebEx graft to help you and your team better understand how you work and collaborate. Here at WebEx, we don't think success can be measured by looking into how many meetings you attend or how many messages you send. We believe that it's your relationships that lead to productive collaboration. We want to put the power of your data in your hands with two new features. First, personal insights will show you how you're spending your most precious resource your time. For example, which relationships are you investing in? And how did those relationships connect you to the broader organization and second team Insights consume ill early Show you if your team is building the relationships it needs to be successful, will help you visualize your team's strongest connections by region by function by office, and you'll be able to see if those ties are in decline or on the rise. With these new additions to people and sights, you'll have all of this intelligence from WebEx graph at your fingertips. Back to you G two. Thank you. Yvonne and Laura were also excited about this area, and if that speak to your interest. Be sure to attend tomorrow's keynote, where you learn a whole lot more about people insights. Now, finally, we want to be sure to deliver a safe, secure, compliant and manageable experience for our customers when they use WebEx. We've built WebEx from the ground up for security, privacy, compliance and manageability in mind rather than an afterthought that was bolted on. And we fundamentally believe that privacy is a basic human right, and this acts as a core guiding principle for us in all of our innovation. Now, while we're miles ahead of our competition, we're taking an even bigger step today.Today, folks, I'm happy to announce the concept of ethical walls, which allow you to set boundaries to keep data private between groups. So, for example, imagine your financial services company, and you don't want your research analysts talking to your investment bankers for regulatory reasons. Or if you're a consulting company and you're advising to direct competitors and you don't want to make sure that those teams interact with each other. Ethical walls allows you to solve this exact problem and maintain this separation. We hope you can see that security is not just an afterthought with WebEx but deeply integrated it into the core fabric and the experience of what we deliver. We look forward to sharing Mawr with you in this area and tomorrow's Kino. Now I hope you've seen a very clear demonstration off breakthrough innovation we've had and the priorities around, making work a much more inclusive place than what it's ever been before and to share a bit more about this. I wanted to show you a quick video to demonstrate the full potential of this technology that the teams put together. Let's roll tape. What does the future of work look like? We see a future with endless possibilities where everyone has a seat at the table. Wherever that table is, we're being productive is different than being busy. A future where devices do more than react. Start my meeting. They respond and distractions. And now a thing of the past. Language is no longer a barrier, and everything you do is secure. We're building technology that serves you're greater perfect, reducing plastic, creating experiences that are even better than being there. The future we see it's seamless, secure and inclusive for all. Yeah, as you've seen the team's been pretty busy innovating to provide great experiences to you. Now, in order to truly delight users, we need the power of our collective ecosystem. We have some exciting announcements with some of our partners, some of whom have been gracious enough to come join us here. And I'm happy to share some of those conversations with you. Enjoy. Hello, everyone. And I am excited because we have a good friend of mine, Aaron Levie, from a CEO of box who's actually with us over here to talk a little bit about the partnership that we've created with WebEx and Box. And that's the only gotten tighter over the course of the past few months. Levy, how are you, man? 82. Good to be here.
 
 -------------------segment-------------- 
 
It seems like you and I haven't stopped chatting since I left box. So that Z, I've only seen you even more so it's good to It's good to be here than at your conference. Yep. And we have some pretty exciting announcements off integrations that we are actually gonna be making. So let's actually see if we could take a look at some of those announcements. So we have a video that we're gonna show before we get into some pretty interesting Q and A with Aaron. Hi, everyone. My name is Michelle. Oh, and I lead our partner Integrations Product management team Met Box. I wanted to provide you with a sneak preview into the new box WebEx integration Coming next year. We're excited to bring together the power of Box and WebEx to create a more seamless collaboration experience. Inbox users will be able to access WebEx right within our file preview. You can either start or schedule a WebEx meeting or share the file into a new team space. Five collaborators will automatically be added to the spacer meeting. And although sharing events will be captured in the box activity feed where you can keep track of the rich contacts in history of your file, we're extremely excited to be launching these features together and can't wait to get them into your hands. Bob Aaron. That's exciting to see that demo, and it seems like the team's done a lot of work in a very short amount of time. And why did you think it was so important for the two of us to partner so closely? But box and WebEx are your customers asking for what was thinking around it? Yeah. So, you know, firstly, obviously we appreciate the partnership Cisco inbox have, I think long shared a vision that the future of work is one where people can work from anywhere, at any time with anyone securely. And this pandemic has only accelerated that move to that new way of working. And so right at the start of March, we saw a rapid increase in usage of both box and WebEx together. So what we wanted to do is make sure that we created more seamless experiences where customers that we're using box could use box for content management securely with WebEx meetings. And with all of the collaboration happening within WebEx so really excited to be able to bring that Teoh market we use, you know, box heavily at Cisco as well. And it's actually pretty exciting to see that the experience in WebEx is gonna be seamlessly integrated with box, and this is only going to get better and better over time. So this we're just starting out with some pieces. But the teams have a pretty lofty vision of what they want to do. over the course of the months and quarters ahead. Uh, walk us through what customers is struggling with right now when they start to think about this kind of hybrid workplace, like, what are they really finding to be difficult?
 
 -------------------segment-------------- 
 
And what can we as a technology community due to really take out the friction for the users? Yeah, it's actually a great point. I think what's happened is there's been two types of companies. There's been some kind of there's been companies that made I t decisions 35 10 years ago, and this has been a blip because they've been able to move remote instantaneously. People worked, uh, you know, very productively. And there's been companies that have had to urgently go in and instantly stand up. A lot of new infrastructure begin to work in new ways. Um, and I think what what we can do is as technology you know, providers and and certainly the ecosystem more broadly, is find more seamless ways to have our technology work together to simplify the user experience and simplify the daily work that employees have to go and do. The rial promise of enterprise software is that it's supposed to make you more productive. Productive is supposed to make you actually more fulfilled that work it. So it's supposed to let you actually accomplish more in your job. And so what we what we wanna be able to do together is is take all of that work. Take all that complexity out of software on Doesn't make it simple to be able to do your job from anywhere. Any device in any location. Aaron, you know, you and I could talk about this for hours on end, but unfortunately, they've only given us so much time that we can actually, uh, share the stage over here. So thank you again for taking all the time. Thio galvanize the teams to work together. And we really appreciate the partnership. I really miss you and the team and a big fan of box and really looking forward. All that we're gonna do moving forward. So really appreciate all that you've done for us, Miss You too. Thanks for you too. Take care. I am delighted to have with me Alan Schneider, Wind Chief Revenue Officer off Salesforce anywhere. And Alan, thank you for joining the show. And we appreciate you being here with us. Thank you. I'm very glad to be here. I know that a big part off all of these technologies working together well is partnerships that all of us as a community of tech providers, you know, continue to make sure that we prioritize. And Salesforce has been at the forefront of all of this.So can you share with us your philosophy on partnerships and Onda? Why Cisco and why are we Why does it make sense for us to partner? Yes, for for us. It really it starts with the customer. It starts with listening to the customers and really taking their cues on being where they want us to be. And something that we realize is we're not gonna be everything for every customer. So it's super important that we have some strategic alliances on. We enter into these partnerships. We don't have that many were very grateful for Cisco and the relationship that we've had for years and really where our relationship started was in the spirit of collaboration, which again has always been a hot topic for our customers. But I would say in the current environment, and as you pointed out, you know, as we look forward will become more and more relevant and mission critical for them. So we're again grateful to be here. I feel like we've just started the journey and there's and there's so much more to come. There's so much more to come. And the nice part about is our teams have been working extremely well and we have integrated our product experiences, um, in a very seamless way. And we're also going to be doing a continued level of stuff to partner on the go to market side. But before we go into the details, let me actually show a demo of the product that the teams have built together, whether it's a completely immersive experience between Salesforce and right back. So we'll just quickly show the demo. Hi, everyone. My name is Ian Henderson and the director of business development and strategy It Salesforce. I'm thrilled to be here at Cisco's very first WebEx one event to give you a first look in the integration between Salesforce and Cisco. WebEx WebEx for Salesforce provides seamless collaboration, minimizing context switches and consolidating vital customer data into salesforce records, meetings, messages and calls, or associated to Leeds opportunities and any other custom objects and can be accessed through WebEx components without leaving Salesforce. We're very excited to bring this to market and combine the power of these two platforms. If you'd like to know more, you can see a deeper dive in Connie Tank session. Thanks and have a great day. That is fantastic. I'm so proud of what the teams have done together, and it happened in such a short amount of time even on that's really appreciate all that the Salesforce team did. And the great news about this is we're just getting started, so there's so much more in the future. What would you say that the future holds for us as to companies that are going to continue to keep partnering? I love what you said about. Start with the customer and work backwards because that's the reason that all these things work well is when you don't overly think about yourself.
 
 -------------------segment-------------- 
 
But think about the experience for the customer. But what was the big value that customers will get from this integration? What should we expect in the future? Yeah, so I think you know, E would say it's very use case focused right now again, it take a sales rep who no longer is in the office and having their Monday morning for cast calls. You know, they have to rethink how they're communicating and collaborating, and again our partnership today. They could do that right within Salesforce without having to leave, and that that's incredible. It helps. But there's so much more again, whether you're selling and you have to re imagine how you're working with customers or if you're a call center agent in the service space on again, I could think through every industry, in a sense, has been disrupted and is reimagining how they're connecting to customers. Yeah, we were really, really excited about all the future possibilities. And we're also excited about taking this integration to market because one of the things that we find the huge amount of cognitive load for people is when they have to keep switching between applications. So the more you can be immersed in wherever the work is happening and have everything else just seamlessly work with that. But that's what users want. That's what customers want. So thank you again for all the support that you've given us. Thank you for, um, you know, uh, taking the time to come to this event. And we really, really appreciate what we've done together, and we actually looking forward to what we're gonna be doing in them in the months and quarters ahead. Thank you. It was great to be here. I am excited to have CJ Desai, my good friend, Chief product officer off service now, which has had an amazing run over the course of the past few years with me over here to talk a little bit more about how we have integrated. Welcome, CJ, how are you doing? I'm doing great. G two. Thanks for inviting me to Cisco WebEx one really excited that you joined Cisco and you are the leader in charge off this great piece of technology among the others. Really appreciate it. Thanks, man. And last time we spoke was when your daughter was gonna be going Thio, I think Stanford She's probably now in sophomore year or something. If I'm not mistaken. How's she doing? Thanks for asking. She's doing great.
 
 -------------------segment-------------- 
 
She loves the college. It's a great campus. Uh, some of the best professors. And I'm sure that when your daughter is ready to hopefully get some advice from her will be here to provide you with that suggestion. Guidance? I'm gonna need to come to you for advice on parenting to raise a kid like that. Then I'm gonna make sure my daughter uses your daughter Is a mentor for sure. She is 9.5. So she's got another few years ago. But, hey, I'm really excited about the partnership that the two of us have. Uh, two of our companies have been able thio form over here, and there's the engineering and product teams have been working really closely together. Onda, before we get get started on the discussion, I thought would be good for us to just see a demo off the product that has been put together. So why don't we see if you can roll tape? Hey, everyone, match Former here, General manager of the business Unit service. Now let's take a quick look at the new integration we're currently building with Cisco WebEx to allow professionals to collaborate seamlessly from service now powered by the WebEx platform, WebEx actions air now surface directly within the service now major incident management user interface that allow agents to open WebEx meeting conference bridges with just a few clicks. Another great capability is I can also broadcast updates as WebEx messages toe all relevant stakeholders. Everyone remains updated without ever having to search for information. The information just finds them lots of new great capabilities. Combining service now is workflow with Cisco WebEx capabilities to deliver awesome experiences for our joint customers. I was an amazing demo. C j thanks again to your team for working with our team and, you know, getting this integration in place. And this is hopefully one of many, many things were going to do together But tell us a little bit about why you think the partnerships important between service now on WebEx. So listen, uh, service now is all of our digital work flows. And I t s, um is our flagship product and within that flagship product, when there is a major I t incident. Many teams come together to collaborate, and we want to make it very easy within idea Sam to launch their bags where teams can collaborate message with each other. They have the right contacts. The meetings happen. Major incident is salt and you can learn a bunch of lessons from it to do a root cause analysis. So we really feel that you know, Cisco WebEx you have many, many joint customers with us at service now. And this thing is going to help improve the productivity off I t staff when they're using idea San Francisco WebEx on d. J.How do you think about just bartering in the ecosystem? Because one of the things in the cloud is it's, You know, all of us are actually making sure that our products integrate well with each other and are they're embedded into yours and your experience in bed into ours. Talk a little bit about the philosophy around partnering and integration of service. Now, So service now g 21 Good thing is, you know the company was founded in 2004 and one off the key tenants off the architectural Waas that every data structure can be access to the r a p I. So now that's a good thing that you can access service now any data structure within a P I and make calls. However, there is still work that has to be done like we have done here between Cisco, where backs in service now. So we believe in integration with every Clark provider. Because every time as ghetto, I'm sure you do and speak to the largest WebEx customers I was gonna call at IBM, and they were using their bags. And IBM is a big customer service. Um, and also for Cisco WebEx. Now, those integrations they've done right and their art of box for both Cisco WebEx and service now or in the cloud as we call it, makes it so much easier. What are great customers to consume our services? Yeah, we The way we think about it, C j is any application that the customers using We ought to make sure that that application has a first class experience when it's integrated into WebEx. So they could work with WebEx. And I'm sure you think about it the same way. Look, I know that this is, uh, um, you know, you've had some tremendous success over the course of the past few years and you've been in service now for quite a while. How long have you been in service? Now? I've been there. Service out four years on, you know, have enjoyed how the ecosystem of service now has evolved. Our partnership has evolved and veto. I'll tell you, were a meeting with our wing and the team at Cisco yesterday where we're going to be the sites Cisco WebEx, which has been a great partnership. We have been partner with AP Dynamics for a long time, a swell, and we're continuing to expect across many Cisco products specifically on how we can provide best in class integration so that end customers have great experience. But we feel so fortunate to have this relationship with you and me personally with you as a good friend. Thank you again for taking all the time to support us and thanks to your team for working so closely with our engineering team to make this happen. And this is hopefully one of the many, many experiences that we'll actually do jointly together and integrating our products tighter and tighter as over the next months and quarters. So appreciate all your help and support. Absolutely. They really happy to partner with you guys, folks, I hope with the innovations we've shared with you, it's become abundantly clear that we're very committed to making sure that the three billion digital workers in the world are able to have equal access to opportunity on that, we're going to level the playing field and with the way that we're going to do that is by making sure that WebEx experiences a 10 X better than in person interactions. And if you do meet in person, we'll make that experience 10 x better as well with the all new WebEx.
